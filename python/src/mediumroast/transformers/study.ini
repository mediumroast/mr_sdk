[Customer_Insights_KeyTheme_Quotes]
1 = Interview recordings is a nice thing to have but honestly I almost never listen to them as it is very time consuming and actually you do not really
    need every single word the customer said.|Julia Voynova, Aha<->Do not do surveys a lot of people will be seduced by their ease and semi-quantitative nature
    ... but they are almost NEVER the right tool. Most orgs would be better off completely discarding them. ... The 1:1 interview or user test remains
    the single best tool for qualitative learning.|Justin Williams, Aha
2 = So we may choose to keep interview notes in GDrive (or Box or DropBox or SharePoint or iCloud). And presentations for customers wherever our sales
    team has chosen for internal publishing. And financial projections in whatever FP&A application our company has settled on. Product management has
    many functional stakeholders, and chances of any single company wide solution are nearly nil.|Rich Mironov, Aha
3 = Thanks, Todd. I did write user personas for 3 types of users we think would be interested in the product. My challenge is that our CEO who is also
    the visionary and product owner identified 3 users from anecdotal vs. actual customer interviews in developing the product.|Ruby Menon, Aha
4 = Start with observing what your prospective customer wants to do, then interview and survey. That will tell you exactly the problem(s) they are
    trying to solve. Then get your designers and development team involved in identifying innovative ways to help them do it faster and better.|David Fradin, Aha
5 = Uh, I think that one of the key things is what are the customer initiatives. This will help me better frame my products and directions accordingly. Level
    of investment from customers as in budget. Are they taking the time to look at competitors. This will help me determine which requirements are the most
    relevant. These kinds of outputs would be great! It would be better than the current state of affairs where we have to continually go back to the field
    and ask some of these data.|Bob OHeir, HDS
6 = I think I use it to validate my own vision and strategy. I use it to validate what I’m hearing from PM, sales, OTP, customers, etc. Given all of that
    I use it to defend where we’re going. Here’s where we’re going and this matches what we see with OTP, etc. We think that this is super valuable and
    use it to reinforce directions, etc. I think that the customer quotes are for me the most valuable. The author of the doc can always sort of spin it.
    At least the perception is that they always have some sort of angle. Even if I wanted to I could not read/listen to the materials. I think that the
    mobile stuff is a little ahead of its time, but maybe if you started now it would be ready for consumption.|Hitachi Data Systems Product Manager
7 = Well the example of talking with the analysts helped me to get a lot more clarity in talking about the problem spaces. This helped my understanding
    overall in the market and also allowed me to build contacts in the industry. Further I keep going back to the data to reuse it for validations and
    results. It actually goes two ways because we can share with them some of the great stuff we’re working on which is kind of symbiotic. They feed
    on the data and make it something digestible they can sell in the world.|Walter Amsler, HDS
8 = I always tend to think. I used to always tell the team that we should have a knowledge share matrix. I love those documents, but sometimes their
    intimidating. Just wondering if there should be a one page executive summary. Just a one page summary. The content is great, but some kind of exec
    summary might be nice. Sometimes just opening the 20-30 page document might be overwhelming.|Rich Rogers, HDS<->Visualization will be very useful, but
    the way that you visualize is highly dependent on who created it. I don’t know how we can create things in a non-uniform way. How can we create
    visuals in different ways? If you want to get a specific answer from the beginning they visualizations are biased. It depends if you’re non-native
    then you may miss the context of the input from audio content. The way that you visualize the data there isn’t an ultimate way to present the data.
    At the same time it is very convincing that you have visuals.|Aki Harada, HDS
9 = Essentially with key terms which will grow over time. I’d also like to see some visualization such as Wolfram Alpha. Number trending, Frequencies,
    meaning of words. I’d start with the key term library internal data, our written reports, but more importantly being able to get to some of the recorded
    data. I’d be thrilled with that, and it doesn’t have to be perfectly automated. Just having our own stuff searchable and be able to search the audio
    content would be huge. Very seldom will the audio content be high fidelity. Sometimes there are follow-up discussions that are followed by another team
    [PM, Eng, Sales] and we don’t see the connection between these studies, yet in some cases we don’t even follow-up. Also we don’t get cold calls and we
    miss customers that we don’t have or haven’t acquired.|Scott Nacey, HDS<->It depends on whether or not I’m going into an area I don’t know very well as
    opposed to this is a topic I understand and I’m going to go more grass roots. Existing market: Bottom up, Emerging market: top down.|Charles Hickman, HDS

[Customer_Insights_Docs]
Introduction = This Customer Insights study includes two phases separated by 5 years.  The first phase was performed as as a part of a 2014 research project that emphasized A/B testing for a customer study indexing application.
    While the second phase, conducted in late 2019, both uncovered new themes and validated key ideas surfaced in the first phase.  In the second phase the emphasis was to investigate a single competitor/partner candidate, Aha!, to
    to determine if the key themes, detected within the first phase, had or had not been already addressed.  While details are accounted for in the Opportunities section, the conclusion is that the themes still largely remain unsolved
    by companies who build tools for product management, project management, and program management disciplines.  Further, research continues to test both the user experience and refine elements of these
    key themes with product managers at companies like Ring Central, Google, Chaos Search, and so on.
Opportunity = Overall the two phases of the study were well paired. Essentially both the first and second phases illustrated that product managers need tooling that enable them to discern the whys behind an effort leadning to a
    distillation of whats needed to build an offer.  Thus there is an opportunity to build a product enabling product managers (and potentially customer success managers) to reveal insights from interactions with users, partners and competitors
    powering efforts ranging from from product modernization to new product introduction. Further, competitive insights surfaced in the second phase related to Aha!.  These insights showed that Aha! has yet
    to tackle features that automatically and systematically use interactions to reveal the whys and whats behind product roadmaps.  (Note that Aha! is highly relevant to sense competitive intelligence because
    they are the leader in market category of Product Management and Roadmapping tooling.)  While these two phases paired well, a weakness was obvious when the two phases were combined:  An intersection
    between them did not clearly surface.  Therefore a third phase was performed to validate and look for clear couplings between the first two phases.  What follows are some of the key
    opportunities discovered through these three phases followed by discrete sections relating systematically uncovered key themes, snippets associated to key themes, and finally abstracts for related interactions.
Opportunity_1 = Formalize Product Relationship Management - Tooling and associated process is needed to enable the build out of the community around the product management team.
Opportunity_2 = Outlive the Product Manager across the entire lifecycle - Product managers are not always present throughout an entire program lifecycle or may leave the company making it essential that source materials and decisioning reasoning stands alone.
Opportunity_3 = Integrate critical stakeholders via tooling - Product Managers are a key part of an overall program, but they do no live on an island making tooling access for a diverse set of stakeholders required.
Opportunity_4 = Reduce the time and effort of product research and feedback correlation - Discerning the core whys and whats of any offer is super critical, but the path to get there is often slow and intransparent.  Therefore, tooling should
    drive speed, improve transparency and reduce work burden.
Opportunity_5 = Forward and backward Traceability from problem to solution - While modern product management and roadmapping tooling facilitates process transparency, getting to clear and key whys and whats is frequently opaque and
    untraceable.  Clearly, revealing the path from problem identication, the whys, to problem resolution, the whats, is a key opportunity for tooling.
Opportunity_6 = Intelligent Information Integration by connecting Productivity, CRM, Support, PM tools - New tooling cannot exist in an island therefore any opportunity requires integration into a user/customer ecosystem.
Opportunity_7 = Visibility and Reporting for relevant stakeholders by themes, products and customers - Beyond kicking off work with engineering many stakeholders want to understand how whys, encoded in key themes, are being
    resolved.  For example customer success managers will need to know how their customers have affected the roadmap, customers themselves would like to understand their level of influence, and
    marketing teams will want to map features to key user pain points.  This means an offer should enable all interested stakeholders to ask and answer key questions beyond the what is needed to drive a roadmap.
