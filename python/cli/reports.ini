key_theme_intro=These are the themes for every sub-study that you elected to include in the report.
    The format for each theme section covering summary and detailed/discrete themes includes the
    theme identifier and description/definition, a fun theme fortune, the themes tags, and a listing
    of quotes.  Note these data are pulled from the system, and if you'd like to modify them you
    would need to modify them in the system prior to generating this report.  Additionally, if you
    make changes to this report they aren't reflected in the system.
summary_theme_intro=This is the summary theme for the entire sub-study.  Using natural language processing
    mediumroast.io has detected the associated tags and quotes matched to the tags.  It is a generalization
    of the sub-study and accompanies the discrete detailed themes.
discrete_themes_intro=Here are the discrete themes for the sub-study.  Since we need enough unique tags to
    check the individual interactions in the sub-study for relevant text snippets and quotes you may find
    discrete themes without quotes.  We do not strike them from the report because we believe it is 
    important to see what the mediumroast.io detected for transparency purposes.
discrete_theme_intro=Each theme, if quotes/snippets are detected, has appropriate data pulled from interactions
    listed below. Additionally, the frequency of each theme is reported to provide the user with a sense of how
    strong the theme is relative to the other themes in the sub-study.
